## Installing python remote (Working with XFOIL integration)

Install anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

run the Anaconda prompt installed

```conda create -n rhinoremote python=2.7 anaconda```

then press 'y' as prompted 

```conda activate rhinoremote```

this will activate the enviroment then install using the PIP manager 

```pip install gh-python-remote```

similarly other packages can be added this way 

```pip install aeropy```

As can be seen in the .gh file the pannel at the top left of the page tells which packages to load
